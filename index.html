            <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
            <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram,Temil Nadu, India</p>
            <p>He served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>
            <p>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined 
                the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p>
            <p> In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III,
                 the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.</p>
            <p>Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.”</p>
            <p>Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>
            <p>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister,
                 and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. </p>
            <p>His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
                 although the tests caused great concern in the international community.</p>
            <p>In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures,
                increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.</p>
            <p>In 1997,Kalam received India’s highest civilian honour,
                The Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. </p>
            <p>In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von
                 Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the manegment and leadership of a space_related project".</p>
            <p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institution of Management Shillong,
                Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 july 2015,aged 83.</p>
               <p>Wheeler Island,a national missile test site in odisha,was renamed Kalam Island in September 2015.</p>
               <p>A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in August 2015.</p>
               <p>In February 2018,scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found place species as Drypetes kalamii,in his honour.</p>r
